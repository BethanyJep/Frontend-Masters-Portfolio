        Programming makes me come alive, strengthens me and empowers me to be
        better
      </p>
      <p>
        When you learn computer programming, you start seeing problems in the
        light of solutions. Your brain starts functioning like that. When you
        encounter a problem after learning to program, you start envisioning the
        possible ways to solve it.You may even foresee some good results out of
        it. However hard the problem might seem, you become determined to act on
        it anyhow. You transform yourself into a solution-driven individual.

        Programming has made me sit at tables I wouldn't if I didn't know how to
        code
      </p>
      <p>
        Just making stuff is one of the greatest joys I get from programming.
        Sadly, it’s the one that I tend to find at work the least. Problem
        solving, fixing and changing are more usual than being a real maker.
        These days, I tend to get this visceral joy more often when I’m involved
        in open source or writing small programs for my own purposes.

        I wanted to at least travel outside the country by the end of the year.
