        Hello. The name's <b>InnCreator</b> living in <em>Kenya</em> working as
        a
        <em>Microsoft Student Partner</em>
      </P>
      <p>
        Moringa School Ambassador -- I am part of a team of students who plan,
        organize technology events on behalf of Moringa School and Codeln. From
        the experience, I am also required to commit at least ten hours a week
        to learn about a technology skill as I have access to different learning
        platforms and do projects after completion
      </p>
      <p>
        Technovation -- I mentored four girls to be able to build an application that will
        create change to the society around them. I taught them how to come up
        with a viable business idea, basic android application development
        concepts, coming up with a business plan and pitching.
      </p>
      <p>
        PR Director Rotaract -- I work together with a board of leaders and together we developed
        creative and innovative ways to engage club members to do various club
        activities. I have gained a lot of experience in digital marketing,
        graphic design, reports and minutes writing, meeting deadlines and
        critical decision-making skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a web developer, I would like to build my portfolio and showcase my
        data scientce projects

          “Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those around you who
          transform into the Force. Mourn them do not. Miss them do not.
          Attachment leads to jealously. The shadow of greed, that is.”
